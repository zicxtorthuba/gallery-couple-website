# 🚀 Cloudinary Upload Widget Implementation

## ✅ Updated Implementation

I've successfully updated your application to use `CldUploadWidget` instead of `CldUploadButton` for much better upload functionality and control.

## 🔧 What's Been Changed

### 1. Gallery Upload (`app/gallery/page.tsx`)
**Before**: `CldUploadButton` (limited functionality)
**After**: `CldUploadWidget` (full control)

```tsx
<CldUploadWidget
  uploadPreset="ml_default"
  onSuccess={handleCloudinaryUpload}
  options={{
    folder: "gallery",
    tags: ["gallery", category],
    context: { title, description },
    multiple: false,
    maxFiles: 1,
    resourceType: "image"
  }}
>
  {({ open }) => (
    <Button onClick={() => open()}>
      <Camera className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Chọn và tải ảnh lên
    </Button>
  )}
</CldUploadWidget>
```

### 2. Blog Editor (`components/blog/BlogEditor.tsx`)
**Before**: `CldUploadButton` (limited functionality)
**After**: `CldUploadWidget` (full control)

```tsx
<CldUploadWidget
  uploadPreset="ml_default"
  onSuccess={handleCloudinaryUpload}
  options={{
    folder: "blog",
    tags: ["blog", "featured-image"],
    context: { title, postId },
    multiple: false,
    maxFiles: 1,
    resourceType: "image"
  }}
>
  {({ open }) => (
    <Button onClick={() => open()}>
      <Upload className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Tải ảnh đại diện
    </Button>
  )}
</CldUploadWidget>
```

### 3. Signed Upload API (`app/api/sign-cloudinary-params/route.ts`)
Created an API endpoint for signed uploads (optional, for enhanced security):

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(
    body.paramsToSign,
    process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET!
  );
  return NextResponse.json({ signature });
}
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits of CldUploadWidget

- **Better UI Control**: Custom button styling and behavior
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload progress feedback
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling and user feedback
- **Multiple Options**: Support for various upload configurations

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Gallery Upload Test
1. Go to your gallery page (`/gallery`)
2. Click "Tải ảnh lên" button
3. Fill in the title (required)
4. Click "Chọn và tải ảnh lên"
5. Upload widget should open
6. Select an image and upload
7. Verify it appears in gallery and Cloudinary dashboard

### 2. Blog Featured Image Test
1. Go to blog editor (`/blog`)
2. Create or edit a blog post
3. Click "Tải ảnh đại diện" in the featured image section
4. Upload widget should open
5. Select an image and upload
6. Verify it appears as featured image

### 3. Cloudinary Dashboard Verification
1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Check Media Library
3. Verify images appear in correct folders:
   - `gallery/` for gallery images
   - `blog/` for blog featured images
4. Check that tags and context are applied correctly

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Upload Preset Configuration
Make sure your Cloudinary upload preset (`ml_default`) has:
- **Signing Mode**: Unsigned (for client-side uploads)
- **Folder**: Can be overridden by widget options
- **Tags**: Can be overridden by widget options
- **Transformations**: Applied automatically during upload

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET="ml_default"
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage (Optional)

### Signed Uploads (Enhanced Security)
For production environments, you can use signed uploads:

```tsx
<CldUploadWidget
  signatureEndpoint="/api/sign-cloudinary-params"
  onSuccess={handleCloudinaryUpload}
  options={{
    folder: "gallery",
    tags: ["gallery", "secure"],
    // ... other options
  }}
>
  {({ open }) => (
    <Button onClick={() => open()}>Upload Securely</Button>
  )}
</CldUploadWidget>
```

### Custom Widget Configuration
```tsx
<CldUploadWidget
  uploadPreset="ml_default"
  options={{
    // Upload options
    folder: "gallery",
    tags: ["gallery"],
    resourceType: "image",
    multiple: false,
    maxFiles: 1,
    
    // Widget appearance
    theme: "minimal",
    showAdvancedOptions: false,
    showCompletedButton: true,
    showUploadMoreButton: false,
    
    // Image transformations
    cropping: true,
    croppingAspectRatio: 16/9,
    
    // File restrictions
    maxFileSize: 10000000, // 10MB
    allowedFormats: ["jpg", "png", "gif", "webp"]
  }}
>
  {({ open, isLoading }) => (
    <Button onClick={() => open()} disabled={isLoading}>
      {isLoading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload Image"}
    </Button>
  )}
</CldUploadWidget>
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Upload Widget Not Opening
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure upload preset exists and is unsigned

### Upload Fails
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for error logs
- Verify file size and format restrictions
- Check network connectivity

### Images Not Appearing
- Verify `onSuccess` callback is working
- Check database insertion logic
- Verify image URLs are correct
